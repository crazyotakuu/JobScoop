## Frontend Unit Tests
This section includes both the React component unit tests and the Cypress end-to-end tests written during Sprint 4.

### A. React Component Unit Tests

**Total Unit Test Cases: 13**

These tests comprehensively validate the data fetching, rendering, interaction, filtering, and error handling workflows of the Trends dashboard. Each test ensures the component responds correctly to user actions, displays dynamic content appropriately, and manages various UI states (loading, error, data-driven rendering).

#### **Trends Component Tests (`Trends.test.js`)**
## ðŸ§ª Unit Test Coverage

### âœ… Trends Dashboard Test Suite

This test suite verifies the functionality, data loading, and user interactions within the `Trends` component using Jest and React Testing Library.

- **Displays loading state initially**  
  Renders a loading message before API data is available.
- **Fetches data on mount**  
  Calls mocked API endpoints to fetch subscription and correlation data when the component mounts.
- **Renders dashboard title after data load**  
  Verifies the presence of "Subscription Trends Dashboard" once the data is loaded.
- **Displays company and role charts**  
  Renders bar charts (mocked) for most popular companies and roles after data is processed.
- **Shows correlation table**  
  Displays a company-role frequency table populated with mocked data.
- **Supports manual date range filtering**  
  Allows users to enter a custom date range using input fields and apply filters.
- **Provides quick filter buttons**  
  Includes filters for "Last 7 days", "Last 30 days", "This month", and "Last month" to quickly update the data.
- **Handles refresh button logic**  
  Clicking "Refresh Data" triggers new API calls and updates the dashboard content.
- **Displays error state on API failure**  
  Shows a user-friendly error message and "Retry" button when data fetching fails.
- **Supports retry logic**  
  Clicking the retry button re-fetches data and restores the dashboard after an error.
- **Renders dashboard statistics**  
  Displays total subscriptions, unique companies, and unique job roles after data is loaded.
- **Handles empty filter results gracefully**  
  Shows a "No data available for the selected date range" message when the filtered dataset is empty.

  
### B. Cypress End-to-End Tests

**Total Cypress Test Cases: 10**

These tests comprehensively validate real user workflows across login, signup, password reset, profile, and subscription management functionalities. Each test ensures the interface behaves correctly, validations are enforced, and backend interactions are handled accurately.


## Backend Unit Tests

### Subscription Unit Tests

- **FetchSubscriptionFrequenciesHandler**: Tests the functionality of `FetchSubscriptionFrequenciesHandler` to get frequencies of each role of interest.
- **FetchAllUserSubscriptionsHandler**: Tests the functionality of `FetchAllUserSubscriptionsHandler` to fetch all individual user subscriptions.

## Request Parameters

This endpoint does not accept any URL parameters or request body.

## Functionality

1.  **Fetch Distinct Companies**  
    Queries the `subscriptions` table for all distinct `company_id` values.
    
2.  **Company Lookup**  
    For each `company_id`, retrieves the humanâ€‘readable company name from the `companies` table.
    
3.  **Total Subscriptions Count**  
    Counts how many subscription rows exist for that company (`COUNT(*)`).
    
4.  **Perâ€‘Role Subscription Count**
    
    -   Expands each subscriptionâ€™s `role_ids` array via `unnest(role_ids)`.
        
    -   Groups by each `roleid` to compute the number of subscriptions per role.
        
5.  **Role Lookup**  
    Maps each `roleid` to its name in the `roles` table.
    
6.  **Frequency Calculation**  
    Computes
    
    `frequency = (subscriptions for this role) / (total subscriptions for the company)` 
    
7.  **Response Assembly**  
    Builds a JSON array where each element contains:
    
    -   `company` (string): company name
        
    -   `role` (string): role name
        
    -   `count` (integer): number of subscriptions for that role
        
    -   `total` (integer): total subscription rows for the company
        
    -   `frequency` (float): `count / total`
        

## Success Response

-   **Status:** `200 OK`
    
-   **Body Example:**
```
[
  {
    "company": "Apple",
    "role": "Software Engineer",
    "count": 12,
    "total": 50,
    "frequency": 0.24
  },
  {
    "company": "Apple",
    "role": "Data Scientist",
    "count": 8,
    "total": 50,
    "frequency": 0.16
  },
  {
    "company": "Google",
    "role": "Backend Engineer",
    "count": 15,

# Fetch All User Subscriptions API

## Endpoint

-   **URL:** `fetch-all-user-subscriptions`
    
-   **Method:** `GET`
    
-   **Content-Type:** `application/json`
    

## Request

This endpoint does not accept any URL parameters or request body.

## Functionality

1.  **Query Subscriptions**
    
    -   Executes a single SQL statement that:
        
        -   Joins `subscriptions` (`s`) with `users` (`u`) to retrieve `u.name`.
            
        -   Joins with `companies` (`c`) to retrieve `c.name`.
            
        -   Unnests the integer array `s.role_ids` via a `CROSS JOIN LATERAL`, producing one row per `(subscription, roleid)`.
            
        -   Joins the unnested `roleid` with `roles` (`r`) to retrieve `r.name`.
            
        -   Groups the results by user name, company name, and `s.interest_time`, aggregating the role names into an array.
            
        -   Orders the output first by user name (ascending) and then by `interest_time` (descending).
            
2.  **Row Scanning**
    
    -   Iterates over the returned rows, scanning into a `UserCompanySubscription` struct:
```
type UserCompanySubscription struct {
  User      string    `json:"user"`
  Company   string    `json:"company"`
  Date      time.Time `json:"date"`
  RoleNames []string  `json:"roleNames"`
}

```
3.  **Error Handling**
    
    -   If the initial query fails, returns a **500 Internal Server Error** with the detailed error.
        
    -   If scanning a row or iterating rows fails, likewise returns **500** with the error message.
        
4.  **Response Construction**
    
    -   On success, returns **200 OK** and the full slice of `UserCompanySubscription` structs, serialized as JSON.
        

## Success Response

-   **Status:** `200 OK`
    
-   **Body Example:**

```

  {
    "user": "Abhinav",
    "company": "Google",
